# Challenge 006

Given a square matrix of size N x N, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denote the matrix's rows, with each line containing space-separated integers describing the columns.

### Constraints

* -100 < = Elements in the matrix < 100

## Output Format

Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.

input:

```
3

11 2 4

4 5 6

10 8 -12
```

output:

15

Explanation:

The primary diagonal is
```
11

  5

    -12
```

Sum across the diagonal is: 11 + 5 -12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:

```
      4

    5

  10
```

Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19

Diference: `4 - 19` = 15
